## Monthly Graduate-Student Workshop on High-Energy Phenomenology

JCP HEP School is a student-led monthly workshop featuring graduate-level, field-building overviews that survey active research areas with emphasis on foundational principles, standard methodologies, and the current state of the art. The series advances two objectives: for speakers, the consolidation of disciplinary fundamentals (core concepts, canonical models, and standard computations); for participants, the development of cross-field literacy that enhances conference engagement and collaborative work.
